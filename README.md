# Neural-Networks-and-Random-Forest
The purpose of this program (final_project.r) is to look at how Neural Networks and Random Forests can be combined together, 
or work seperately to classify a data set. The three data sets are Tyrosine10, Tyrosine5, and Tyrosine2. The three data sets 
range in difficulty, with Tyrosine10 being the easiest to classify, and Tyrosine2 being the most difficult. 

The script creates three models, a random forest, a neural network, and a neural network that gets its neurons from the 150 most
importance varibles as determined by the random forest. 800 samples are used for training each model, and 234 are used for
validation.
